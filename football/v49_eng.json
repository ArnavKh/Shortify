Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. Which leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dieing on the cross. 3 days later he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. Thus does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God everyday. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress God. A few words out of the heart is better than saying a bunch words to impress and not mean. This does not mean praying long prayers is bad.<br>Acts 16:31<br>They replied, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household.&quot;<br>H<br>Jesus Loves his Children ‚ù§Ô∏è"

For example that shot so easy when you are training like it take about a day to learn but when it comes to the match you can&#39;t even pass easily due to pressure and circumstances and intensity so stop watching thses videos and work on you stamina which helps you to get got breath in and keep pressure out of mind,work on intinctive passing which is secret pros don&#39;t tell its type of passing where your body make things automatically you just work using your instincts so you can use your brain on something else like looking for space in splits second when you work on passing your shooting will automatically become better naturally.. and last thing wokr on acceleration with long touches dribbling this is only two main things which people ignore beacuse on the pitch you need passing and Long touches with sharp legs to keep defenders away ... I hope you got it. And last one stop leaning skills .. they effect your game negatively... Believe me. üëçüèº"
