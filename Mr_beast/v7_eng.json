I emailed back and forth with your company for months and sent it to them only for them to finally say they don&#39;t know what it is, but not to worry bc the cookies are discontinued now. Would you be happy with that resolution? I just wanted to know what it was since it had been in my mouth but your company didn&#39;t really care and offered me candy bars to make up for it. I have lots of photos if you care to see or take a guess at what it might be."
