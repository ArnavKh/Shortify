It blows my mind hun how many subscribers you have. It’s so awesome you have helped so many people. I wish I could win the lottery I would first build the biggest place for all animals that need a forever home. Then I would help people that had nothing cause I have been poor my whole life even tho I worked full time for 26 yrs I am still poor but I have a roof over my head and I do feed 2 colonies of cat everyday. I can’t afford to get the kitties spayed and neutered I have reached out for help with the aspca and still can’t find anyone to help with these precious animals. We have the very worst animal control and animal shelter in this world I do believe. They don’t care and it breaks my heart. I live in south west Ga. and the summer has been brutal on these cats but I just keep them fresh water. Walmart had these big plastic bowls for 99cent and that’s what I got to put there water in they are big and made good for just a buck. Take care thank you for helping those animals I saw in your list of things you have done. Bless your heart I bet you get so many people asking you for money. Help the ones that God leads you to help from your list I saw your a very good young man. 🫶🏼"
