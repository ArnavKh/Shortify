The gorilla didn’t have the iconic silver back nor did it look anything like a real gorilla. 2. It had the closest proportions to a human from all the animals. The alligator would be impossible to fit in,  the lamma was obviously eating, showing its mouth, meaning it can’t be it and the cow, it just seemed real to me. The guy shouldn’t have taken the whole time to choose, it was quite obvious! The gorilla looked incredibly fake.</i><br>🤓☝️"

I know the aligator is there but no human can turn that small, not even a child. Excluding the aligator, we are left with the cow, gorilla and alpaca/llama. Same with the alpaca/llama, no human can control it&#39;s mouth like shown on the video. Now we are left with only the cow and gorilla. If you saw, at the start of the clip, the cow is shown eating grass and it also blinks in the video. Now, the only choice s the gorilla with some other reasons too like its lack of movement and articulation in the arms especially and it is shown occasionally turning its face back. So yeah.."

I&#39;m still on the road to recovery but every second of every day I think about the ones that are not as Lucky. If I ever get on my feet all my time will go towards helping others get on there feet. So please Mr Beast if I can join one challenge ALL PROFITS WILL GO TOWARDS HELPING THE ONES WHO REALLY NEED IT.<br><br><br>Ps. If I wasn&#39;t for the people that had nothing but gave me all they could I would be 6feet under ground, at this moment all money I&#39;m making by casual work I&#39;m saving to try and help them. I&#39;m scared it might come too late<br><br><br>pps; I&#39;ll do anything (I&#39;ll even TATTOO MY HEAD, I&#39;ll live in a forest, wilderness alone, face any fear, I&#39;ll go to the extreme) to prove myself and help the people that have no home, no clothes, walk 40+km per day just to make enough to buy hopefully a bread for a day...THANK YOU <br><br><br>Kind regards <br><br>Marie Marais"
