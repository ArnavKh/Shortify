            "text": "🔴 QUESTION: Will there be a second chance for salvation after death? <br><b>****************************</b><br>🔴 Dear people, don&#39;t waste your life! Your sins can be forgiven surely by the Lord Jesus Christ! Repent and believe the Gospel! The LORD JESUS Christ spoke about His return. <br><br>🔴 ANSWER: While the idea of a second chance for salvation is appealing, the Bible is clear that death is the end of all chances. Hebrews 9:27 tells us that we die, and then face judgment. So, as long as a person is alive, he has a second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. chance to accept Lord Jesus Christ and be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31). Once a person dies, there are no more chances. <br>—————<br>● Hebrews 9<br>27. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:<br>28. So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.<br>—————<br>🔴 The Apostle John when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven:<br>—————<br>● Revelation 1<br>17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I Am the First and the Last:<br>18. I Am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I Am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the KEYS of Hell and of death.<br>—————<br>🔴 If ever someone should have repented when given a second chance to see clearly the truth, it was the rich man. But although he was in torment in fire, he only asked that Abraham send Lazarus back to earth to warn his brothers so they didn’t have to suffer the same fate. There was no repentance in his heart, only regret for where he found himself. Abraham’s answer says it all: “And he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even though one rose from the dead” (Luke 16:31). Here we see that the witness of the Scriptures is sufficient for salvation for those who believe it, and no other revelation will bring about salvation to those who do not. No second, third, or fourth chances would be enough to turn the heart of stone into a heart of flesh.<br><br>🔴 What about those who do not believe? Wouldn’t they repent and believe if they were given a second chance? The answer is no, they would not because their hearts are not changed simply because they die. Their hearts and minds “are at enmity” against God and won’t accept Him even when they see reality of Heaven. This is evidenced clearly in the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31.<br><br>🔴 Moreover and of big importance against the deceptive teachings of Satan who deceives people by those he possesses: Abraham tells the rich man that it is impossible for anyone there to come to Heaven from the torments of fire or vice versa. (Luke 16:26)<br>If someone is in the home of the dead, in torment, waiting for judgment, will not enter to Heaven! It&#39;s impossible!<br>If someone tells you otherwise is deceiver. <br><br>🔴 To understand what happens to nonbelievers after they die, we go to Revelation 20:11-15 which describes the Great White Throne judgment and the Lord Jesus is the Judge of mankind John 5:22 &quot;For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son&quot;. <br><br>🔴 Here takes place the opening of the books and “the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” The books contain all the thoughts and deeds of those being judged, and we know from Romans 3:20 that “by the works of the Law is no flesh justified.” Therefore, all who are judged by their works and thoughts are condemned to Hell. Believers in Christ, on the other hand, are not judged by the books of works, but their names are found written in another book: the “Lamb’s Book of Life” (Revelation 21:27). These are the ones who have believed on the Lord Jesus, and they alone will be allowed to enter heaven.<br><br>🔴 The key to understanding this is the Lamb’s Book of Life. Anyone whose name is written in this book was “saved before the foundation of the world” (Ephesians 1:4) by God’s sovereign saving grace to be part of His Son’s bride, the church of Jesus Christ. These people need no “second chance” at salvation because their salvation has been secured by Christ. He chose us, He saved us, and He will keep us saved. Nothing can separate us from Christ (Romans 8:39). Those for whom He died will be saved because Lord Jesus will see to it. He declared “all that the Father has given Me will come to Me” (John 6:37), and “I give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand” (John 10:28). For believers, there is no need for a second chance because the first chance is sufficient.<br><br>🔴 In Philippians 2:10-11 we have this testimony: “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” One day, everyone will bow before Lord Jesus and recognize that He is The Lord and The Savior. At that point, though, it will be too late for salvation. After death, all that remains for the unbeliever is judgment and damnation in Hell fire for eternity (Matthew 25:41, Mark 9: 43-44, 2-Peter 3:7, Revelation 20:14-15, Revelation 21:8). <br><br>That is why we must trust in Lord Jesus Christ in this life. That is why we must follow the Lord Jesus Christ!<br>—————<br>● Matthew 4<br>17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>—————<br>● Matthew 28 <br>19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I Am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<br>—————<br>● Mark 6<br>12. And they went out, and preached that men should repent.<br>—————<br>● Acts 2<br>38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
