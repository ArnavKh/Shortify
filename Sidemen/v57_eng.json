He was born of a virgin and lived a life without sin, though He was tempted in every way as we are. He went on the cross and He willingly took our sins past, present and future. Jesus died in my place for my sins, paying my debt to God and purchasing my salvation. Jesus died but He rose on the third day victory over satan, sin, demons and hell. Jesus tells us to share this story of the Good News and there‚Äôs a God that lovingly pursues us. Jesus is coming to judge the living and the dead and those who trust in God will forever be with Him in His Kingdom and those who do not will suffer forever in hell."
