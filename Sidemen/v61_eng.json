If u wanna be saved today read this.<br>The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23.<br>And to go to heaven we need to be perfect revelation 21:27. But God says we can&#39;t earn our salvation because we aren&#39;t perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  we simply believe on Jesus Christ&#39;s   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.<br>And it&#39;s only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47.
