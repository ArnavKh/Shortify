A lake usually has too much volume of water and goes too deep for the colder temperatures to penetrate... so even if ice were denser than water, i dont see how the ice will hold up as ice under water if it sunk to the bottom."

Plants still grow under the ice in the winter and release oxygen in the winter. As ice gets thicker, and especially if it gets a layer of snow on it, less light passes through to the plants. When photosynthesis slows or stops, the plants stop consuming carbon dioxide and emitting oxygen. Fish then die. There is less oxygen in the lake in winter because there is no oxygen absorption when the lake is iced over. Thats why the photosynthesis of underwater plants is so important. Thats why sometimes the people in charge plow snow off big parts of a lake. Its to increase light transmission, not so ice fishermen can get on the lake easier."

I buried the one I reached, but the next spring I saw the one that sank in the block of ice swimming around... I&#39;m not denying NDT has the physics right, but the has got the biology wrong.

Supposing that the air around the lake drops well below zero, the ice in contact with the water below it will be especially cold, and since heat naturally rises wouldn&#39;t that result in the ice layer gradually becoming thicker and thicker from the top down? The reverse situation as Neil described, essentially? It still seems like the lake would freeze over since the water at the lake&#39;s surface is in direct contact with ice."

It&#39;s not only because of the density of the water it&#39;s because : on the top when you have ice it is static and under the ice  the water is moving because of the movement of the water it cannot be turned into ice not only because of the density of the water... If you understood nature you would never talk about it ;you know why? because you would understand the human nature ;and human nature is horrible the mankind is here on planet Earth ,to take care of the animals and of the planet and instead we are ruining it. so if you want to know... when you get the knowledge you will shut up!!

Top it up with an amazingly complex human brain, the only &quot;machine&quot; that can think about itself autonomously. I have 2 PhDs in biosphere science and molecular genetics, but nothing convinces me that life is the product of blind evolution and that there&#39;s no Creator God who purposely designed and set all the optimum conditions that make life possible and enjoyable. Here&#39;s something to think about: we often talk about the  &quot;laws&quot; of physics, of the universe etc, before humans came into existence, those laws were already there, everyday experience tells us &quot;laws&quot; must be made or written, so who wrote the laws of the universe so that humans could study them, and why are those laws so perfect and constant, that based on them humans can predict space travel and launch machines into space and to other planets successfully to precision, who maintains these laws to finely tuned to accuracy and precision? Is it just by chance that the earth / moon somehow has not drifted into the Sun or farther away from it so that life continues for us nicely?"
