            "text": "The demise of ancient Egypt ?\r<br>The Ancient Egyptian Empire was one of the oldest and longest ruling empires in history. The empire lasted over 3,000 years. During that time the empire rose and fell as power shifted from one clan to the next and the occasional invasion from neighboring empires. However, history shows that even the mightiest empires can fall and after 1,100 BC, Egypt went into decline. There were several reasons for this including a loss of military power, lack of natural resources, and political conflicts.  \r<br>The reigns of the last great pharaohs Ramses II and Ramses III 1,189 BC to 1,077 BCE are identified by strength and ability to defend Egypt against invaders. However, it took manpower and resources to ward off these continual attacks and these defenses left the economy‚Äôs empire struggling.Egypt experienced a civil war and remained split between two regions. This left it endangered to further invasions and control from the Assyrians in 671 BCE, the Persians in 525 BCE and finally the Greeks in 332 BCE.\r<br>At the end of Egypt‚Äôs empire the climate became unreliable and unstable. The Egyptians relied on the water from the Nile floods to help their crops grow, but the Egyptian climate experiences roughly a hundred of years of dry spells and hundreds of years water became uncommon.\r<br>There were also periods of unusually cold weather that further stressed the crops and led to a dramatic decrease in harvests. Crops were also destroyed by strong and unpredictable flooding of the Nile. With little to no food or surplus for long periods of time, hunger and famine spread.\r<br>Economic and political unrest also led to the weakening of the Ancient Egyptian empire. There were huge inequalities in the distribution of wealth among the elites and the rest of the population. Many people began to distrust the government and religious authority. The continuous wars created huge expenses and weakened the economic power of the Pharaoh.\r<br>Christianity began to spread through Egypt and brought the adoption of the alphabet replacing hieroglyphics and creating major changes in Egyptian culture. Many ancient practices such as mummification ended"

Can he enter a second time into his mother&#39;s womb and be born?‚Äù 5 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.[c] 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, ‚ÄòYou[d] must be born again.‚Äô 8 The wind[e] blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.‚Äù<br><br>9 Nicodemus said to him, ‚ÄúHow can these things be?‚Äù 10 Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúAre you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you[f] do not receive our testimony. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.[g] 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.[h]<br><br>For God So Loved the World<br><br>16 ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world,[i] that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.‚Äù (Also the flood is the disaster that happened) What would explain how they carried the stones is the fact that back then Humans were giants, but because of Adam and Eve eating of the apple, they got farther from God, which would indicate a decrease in stature. God is big strong, and intelligent, and good, but because we were made in the image of God, and we are corrupting it with sin, we become less and less of what God is naturally. The nephilim were giants compared to humans because the fallen angels would have sexual relations with women of the earth. This implies that either the nephilim had more knowledge because of the fallen angel parent (they were also brutal and savage giants who would ruthlessly conquer and subject humans to be under them, part of the fallen angel nature) this could also be that the fallen angels gave them information on technology, but God did not give it to humans because he knew that they would hurt each other in horrendous ways because they could simply not be trusted with it because of the evil nature. I mean look at us today, we are having nukes pointed at each other, and have enough nukes to bomb the whole earth (Russia and the US have the power to destroy the earth‚Äôs life entirely, some people or creatures would survive, most would not.) plus the nephilim were big giants that could carry larger things than the regular humans could, the humans were still bigger, so the nephilim would be even larger."

Many people find it profound that pyramids are found around the world, but that‚Äôs like finding philosophical meaning in most modern structures around the world are square or rectangular. The reason is the architectural stability inherent in the shape. Pyramids are found around the world because of the very primitiveness of the societies building them. Without technologies like advanced metallurgy, the pyramidal shape provides the large base with narrow tip which allowed them to reach heights otherwise unachievable without the materials which exist today with which we build skyscrapers in a straight path upwards. Yet, even with the largest bases, pyramids are still limited to a relative shortness. The pyramidal shape, if anything, is the proof of the primitive society. What is likeliest is that the societies involved had a technology that would seem advanced to us but was possible then that enabled them to move/fashion these stones in ways we‚Äôve yet to think of."

But we can recover some of that knowledge through ancient texts, and these beautiful investigative journalists out here doing gods work. They all have pieces of the truth.

They are not aliens, they are half humans and half children of fallen angels and spiritual creatures who used to walk with humans and some slept with human women who were used as oracle&#39;s by ancient pagan priets... these Giants are naphtalims and other type of hybrid creations. They instructed rulers on how to rule, how to build and what to do in those days as god&#39;s. People worshiped them such as zeus, Neptune etc... and they want to regain their power and want people of the world to worship them like before. The Bible referred to them briefly as the legends and mythology of old. At this time there was alot of violence and immorality on the earth so the great flood came to wipe them out. They all got pushed into caves and under water kingdoms, some returned to heavenly realms (not the kingdom of God, the heavens far below God&#39;s kingdom) and some died. The titans (arch angels that fell where bound in hades) till the end of age where they will be released. They will come back to reclaim earth as &quot;aliens&quot; with advance technology, but its really just satanic knowledge with spirituality influence. This will and can only happen  once the true children of God are raptured, they will reveal themselves as aliens to the world so the humans can accept them and they will work with governments and world leaders like before so all the earth worship them through their advance technologies (AI) and they will instruct leaders on how to rationalise the rapture to the masses as scientic event and not a rapture to discredit everything the Christians warned the world about. They will ban Christianity/ talk of the rapture. And the only reason they are no longer allowed on the earth and cannot come before that time is because the Christians are still on the earth. But when we ture believers are taken in the rapture all bets are off, the heavens collapse, they will can re-emerge out of the sea, the caves and the sky (other planets) to the earth from their hiding places and all will be forced to accept them through biotechnology by selling their souls to advanced technologies to survive(microchipping of humans to buy &amp; sell in a new digital currency, digital world where they upload your memory on the &#39;cloud use clones to make people live &#39;eternally&#39; outside of God üòÇ).  Those who reject will be annihilated like sport just like the days of gladiators where the Christians were killed in collosiums as sport. Thats why the media has been indoctrinating society to get used to programs that are based on extreme elimination and contest so they won&#39;t be adverse to seeing people being literally eliminated for sport. Those believers who were not ready for the rapture will be persecuted &amp; killed like animals on shows like big brother, love Island, the circle, the cube, galdiators, total wipe out, squid games etc except these shows will be real with real consequences like hunger games for everyone to watch on TV... These beasts are the inhabitants of darkness and the governing spirits behind astrology and why people of certain demographics/race/groups/genders/&#39;signs&#39; etc... act a certain way. There are spirits/principalities that govern human behaviours.  They are actually principalities as the Bible explains (humans refer to them as gods) some live in the heavens and spiritual people/pagans worship them as gods, but they&#39;re actually principalities and rulers of spiritual realms but nothing I mean NOTHING in comparison to God who created them before they fell into evil along with their leader the devil. So yes Greek mythology, Egypt mythology, African mythology etc... are all true but they were wipped out and phased out dispensation after dispension and spiritual laws change by each event and time. Christ is the only true salvation and without Him there is no salvation. Give your life to Christ, repent and be saved while there is still time. Please don&#39;t be fooled. Complacency is the biggest demise to humanity... find salvation of Christ and don&#39;t turn back. simple"

The Great Pyramid and probably the Sphinx were already there. The Egyptians just refurbished/repaired/repurposed what was there and may have built more because the descendants of Ham (Noah&#39;s third son) carried/employed the knowledge of the old world before the Flood. The pre-Flood builders had some form of atomic power. The antediluvian scientists caused the destruction in Noah&#39;s day by scanning the sky all the way to the moon, looking for water. They wanted to prove Noah was crazy and their very efforts brought the Flood. I wonder if the proliferation of Doppler weather radar and all radar isn&#39;t what is producing our climate changes?"

For moving heavy stones they also made holes for tuning forks so they can vibrate the stone during the move, reducing friction.
