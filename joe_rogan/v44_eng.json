I&#39;m being sarcastic, but why is he talking like we&#39;ve unearthed some unanswered riddle by translating his speeches with AI? It&#39;s not like his speeches were well kept secrets, I&#39;ve been watching WW2 documentaries since I was in High school. I agree that it hits different when spoken in a language you understand but the way he said it just made it seem like nobody ever knew what he was talking about before. We knew what he was saying, you just need to stop and read the dang subtitles."

Which is natural. <br><br>But when you look at begining and forget outcome... He had support somewhere far away from Germany. <br><br>Maybe he was installed, used, and then they let him go downstream pretending that they never supported him. <br><br>Very few countries really fought against him from start, most joined resistance when it was obvious that he&#39;ll lose. <br><br>The question is : was it yet another proxy war, was he installed and sponsored puppet, actor? <br><br>And then, look at the outcome in Europe :  who got Europe as satellite? And it&#39;s still same till today. <br>European moves are often not aligned with European interests, but with interests of other country. <br><br>He was, in my opinion, sponsored, trained, installed, used, and then thrown in the trash can."

But the difference between you and a German citizen in the 30s is, that you already know what happened after and that it doesn&#39;t line up with the speeches content. The population was sweet talked and blinded so they wouldn&#39;t see that they were being repressed and those that did see, were intimidated enough to keep shut and those that didn&#39;t, got a one way train ride.<br>Those speeches are still as dangerous today as they were in their own time."

I know he&#39;d almost for sure kick the shit out of me if I said that to his face but, hopefully, this comment won&#39;t have him hunting me down up here in Canada to teach me a lesson about being a big mouth &quot;telephone tough guy.&quot; I know there&#39;s a word for saying shit about people on the internet that you wouldn&#39;t dare say to their face but I forget what it is. Anyways, Joe and I are very close in age so he knows what a &quot;telephone tough guy&quot; is and, honestly, I&#39;m pretty ashamed of myself for doing it because it really is a pussy move but I really have to say this. Why in the f**k is Joe just realizing now that Hitler wasn&#39;t screaming blatant threats to a major part of his country&#39;s population before he was even elected? I don&#39;t know about Joe but every documentary I watched about Hitler, all the way back to when I was in high school, they had these things called.&quot;subtitles.&quot; For the very young folks, subtitles were printed words that ran on the bottom of whatever screen you were watching where they speak a different language than you would. So even if Hitler was speaking German backwards it wouldn&#39;t make one difference and even if he was, unless you spoke German, you wouldn&#39;t even know. Anyways, I was too busy reading what he was saying translated to English, I doubt I would have noticed if Hitler was quacking like a friggin&#39; duck. I just don&#39;t get this. Why is Joe just realizing now something that any idiot our age would have known for decades now? I just don&#39;t understand why Joe had no idea what Hitler was saying in those speeches until now? I&#39;m sincerely confused why Joe would say something that makes him sound like he&#39;s half retarded? Anyways, please don&#39;t anybody show Joe this comment. It seems like I&#39;m probably quite smarter than him but I&#39;m 99.99% sure that I&#39;d get the living shit kicked out of me if I fought him. So, please don&#39;t show him this but if you know why he&#39;s saying such ridiculously stupid things, please let me know. I&#39;m still so confused right now.... Damn."

Death wasnt something they were worried about in 50years time ehy would they give up pain relief or energy or comfort when theyd watch most men they know die in war or have injuries where they wished theyd died. And most were wondering if theyd survive the winter... do yeah it wad live long and well mentality like today it was survive long enough to raise your kids and hopefully theyd be able to take care of you when tou can no longer do so.

But as we all know, that original hate is what helped bring him into power. There were also a lot of moral issues that the Jews accepted at the time, that were big issues for Hitler and his Cronies. Also Germany Was embarrassed and defeated from WW1, and their economy was heavily dependent on the U.S. Stockmarket. So when when it crashed in the thirties, they took a big hit and it destroyed a lot of jobs and peoples lives. And after they rebuilt their country and not wanting to go back to poverty. Was the sole reason why they fought so ferociously and fiercely. With many just trying to be patriots of thier country, but at what cost‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.."

More evidence Trump now uses Hitler‚Äôs language of calling people Berman and saying that they are poisoning the blood of America right out of Hitler‚Äôs playbook. Other interesting facts Trump has told more lies than any other president and what he has learned that from Hitler if you tell a lie over and over and over again, people will believe you and that is exactly what Trump does no matter how absurd the lie is Trump will repeat it over and over again. He says he wants to be a dictator. He says he wants to execute some of the generals who are against him. This man allows, confederate flags, KKK banners at rallies. He admires dictators and says so Americans need to watch out and wake up. We do not want this. Hitler loving Hitler imitating president in the White House again he‚Äôs telling us every day all the vengeance and the revenge.

As a result France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr (an industrialized area) so they could recover goods in exchange for money. Germans decided to retaliate, going on strike  and refused to make goods. This caused the German government to keep printing more money to pay the strikers so they could afford to strike. This caused a chain reaction, printing money ended lowering the value of their Mark to the point where a loaf of bread that cost 0.68 marks in 1918 cost 201,000,000,000 marks in 1923. Essentially the mark could be used as toilet paper at that point, and the governments idiocy essentially created a Hyperinflation. This made the German people angry and hungry. Hitler promised to give the German people a security (food on the table, jobs and etc.) and as a result, they voted for him and he delivered, but at a price."

The country is in economic ruin &amp; he convinces most of the country to get onboard with his ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù that will ‚Äúfix‚Äù the country. Well, the guy is a lunatic and a sociopath. Pretty soon he starts scapegoating the Jewish people &amp; blaming them for the country‚Äôs problems, and obviously it devolves from there. What is important to remember is that most Germans were NOT N*zis. The majority of civilians were in survival mode &amp; were drafted into a war they did not want to fight, were made to follow orders that went against their beliefs, OR be sent to a camp, k*lled &amp; have a target put on their entire family. Tens of thousands of truly innocent civilians d*ed as a result of the war, including millions of Jewish people. History must be learned from or it will be repeated, and that goes for every country, including the US.

Of course it&#39;s great rhetoric but it&#39;s not new that they can translate him they can colorize pictures and anybody could have translated him German and English... People have mixed together for hundreds of years and they&#39;ve translate each other&#39;s languages for hundreds of years and they all go back to romantic languages... How bizarre this guy is talking about translation is new and there&#39;s something good about this this guy is demented and he&#39;s probably going to be like rush or Alex and the rest of the people that lost everything"

I haven&#39;t seen the translation in english, but just because he was drugged it doesn&#39;t mean what he said was wrong. Again, dont know what hmHitler said, but i hate seeing that people do this. Back then drugs were common. It was even in chocolate and Coca Cola. Some people drink and tell others how important they are or even tell the hurtful truth to other. That doesn&#39;t mean its wrong. I hope i see people stop trying to kiss ass to others like that twitch guy or people discredit others, simply because they got different views or opinions."

It‚Äôs pronounced, well, rizz, just like it‚Äôs spelled. The term found its way into teen slang through TikTok and other social media. Rizz isn‚Äôt being hot ‚Äî though that can be part of it. And it isn‚Äôt being cool ‚Äî although, again, that‚Äôs a factor.<br><br>Rizz, to borrow from slang of generations past, is game.<br><br>It started off as teen slang, and now it&#39;s in the dictionary. It beat out &quot;Swiftie,&quot; &quot;situationship&quot; and &quot;beige flag,&quot; among others, to be named the Oxford English Dictionary&#39;s word of the year.<br><br>Earlier, Merriam Webster announced that it added 690 new words to the dictionary this year, and rizz was one of them.<br><br><br>‚ÄúSigns of a healthy language include words being created, words being borrowed from other languages, and new meanings being given to existing words,‚Äù Merriam-Webster explains on its website. ‚ÄúBased on our most recent research, we are pleased to inform you that English is very (very!) healthy.‚Äù<br><br>What does rizz mean? Here are examples<br>Spider-Man actor Tom Holland put the term in the mainstream spotlight when he claimed, in a Buzzfeed interview, to be sorely lacking in rizz.<br><br>‚ÄúI have no rizz whatsoever, I have limited rizz,‚Äù he said ‚Äî although his legions of fans may disagree.<br><br>Holland pointed out that he is happily in a relationship, so has no need for rizz at the moment.<br><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s short for charisma. And it&#39;s used to describe somebody who is seductive,&quot; says Titania Jordan, chief parenting officer of Bark, an online monitoring company that aims to keep kids safe online and in real life, and which carefully tracks teen slang as part of its mission.<br><br>Jordan Catalano had rizz (Gen X, iykyk). From the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian (Calrizzian?) have it. And, I would argue, both the Mandalorian and the actor who portrays him, Pedro Pascal, belong in that category, but here&#39;s where we get into personal opinion: Rizz is in the eye of the beholder.<br><br>Westley from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;; Paxton from &quot;Never Have I Ever&quot;; Meg from &quot;Hercules&quot;: all potential rizz gods.<br><br>Types of rizz<br>Donkey from ‚ÄúShrek‚Äù has ‚Äúmad rizz,‚Äù according to my 13-year-old son. After all, Donkey did sweet talk a literal dragon into falling in love with him.<br><br>‚ÄúW rizz,‚Äù says my teen expert: This is the best kind of rizz, and the opposite of ‚ÄúL rizz,‚Äù which would in fact be negative rizz, or actively repelling people.<br><br>If your rizz is &quot;mid,&quot; that&#39;s also not good.<br><br>Comedian Trey Kennedy perfectly nails rizz (and the general experience of living with a middle schooler) in his video.<br><br>If you missed the rizz train, don&#39;t fret: The term is relatively new.<br><br>What does having rizz, or no rizz, mean?<br>The opposite of rizz, Jordan notes, is &quot;cringe.&quot; Cringe is also what happens when parents try to use their teens&#39; slang. If you&#39;re going to attempt it, though, note the usage: A person has (or doesn&#39;t have) rizz, but one is (or is not) cringe.<br><br>Rizz is not, as my 13-year-old tried to tell me, what kids say when someone studies hard and is really good at school.<br><br>Recommended<br>TEENS<br>‚ÄòCaught in 4k‚Äô: What the slang phrase really means<br>‚ÄúOh, so when your friends say you‚Äôve got rizz, it means you‚Äôre working hard at school?‚Äù<br><br>Nice try, kid.<br><br>Have a little rizz-spect for your mother.<br><br><br>Rebecca Dube<br>Rebecca Dube is the Head of TODAY Parents, Digital, and a mom of two boys.

Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world, with the open-world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world in a dynamic and seamless manner. Open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game&#39;s linearity.[5]<br>While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds, the main draw of open-world games is about providing the player with autonomy‚Äînot so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game (which is nearly impossible with current computing technology), but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules.[6] Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open-world concept such as the Fallout series. The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that it provides a simulated reality and allows players to develop their character and its behavior in the direction and pace of their own choosing. In these cases, there is often no concrete goal or end to the game, although there may be the main storyline, such as with games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.<br>Gameplay and design<br>An open world is a level or game designed as nonlinear, open areas with many ways to reach an objective.[7] Some games are designed with both traditional and open-world levels.[8] An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels,[5] or a level with more linear challenges.[9] Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective.[9] Some games actually use real settings to model an open world, such as New York City.[10]<br>A major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline.[11] Since players may perform actions that the game designer did not expect,[12] the game&#39;s writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom.[13] As such, games with open worlds will sometimes break the game&#39;s story into a series of missions, or have a much simpler storyline altogether.[14] Other games instead offer side-missions to the player that do not disrupt the main storyline. Most open-world games make the character a blank slate that players can project their own thoughts onto, although several games such as Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole offer more character development and dialogue.[5] Writing in 2005, David Braben described the narrative structure of current video games as &quot;little different to the stories of those Harold Lloyd films of the 1920s&quot;, and considered genuinely open-ended stories to be the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for the fifth generation of gaming.[15] Gameplay designer Manveer Heir, who worked on Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect Andromeda for Electronic Arts, said that there are difficulties in the design of an open-world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design, in contrast to a linear progression, and needs to be a factor in the game&#39;s development from its onset. Heir opined that some of the critical failings of Andromeda were due to the open world being added late in development.[16]<br>Some open-world games, to guide the player towards major story events, do not provide the world&#39;s entire map at the start of the game, but require the player to complete a task to obtain part of that map, often identifying missions and points of interest when they view the map. This has been derogatorily referred to as &quot;Ubisoft towers&quot;, as this mechanic was promoted in Ubisoft&#39;s Assassin&#39;s Creed series (the player climbing a large tower as to observe the landscape around it and identify waypoints nearby) and reused in other Ubisoft games, including Far Cry, Might &amp; Magic X: Legacy and Watch Dogs. Other games that use this approach include Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man.[17][18][19][20] Rockstar games like GTA IV and the Red Dead Redemption series lock out sections of the map as &quot;barricaded by law enforcement&quot; until a specific point in the story has been reached.<br>Games with open worlds typically give players infinite lives or continues, although some force the player to start from the beginning should they die too many times.[5] There is also a risk that players may get lost as they explore an open world; thus designers sometimes try to break the open world into manageable sections.[21] The scope of open-world games requires the developer to fully detail every possible section of the world the player may be able to access, unless methods like procedural generation are used. The design process, due to its scale, may leave numerous game world glitches, bugs, incomplete sections, or other irregularities that players may find and potentially take advantage of.[22] The term &quot;open world jank&quot; has been used to apply to games where the incorporation of the open world gameplay elements may be poor, incomplete, or unnecessary to the game itself such that these glitches and bugs become more apparent, though are generally not game-breaking, such as the case for No Man&#39;s Sky near its launch.[22]<br>Open world, sandbox games, and emergent gameplay<br>The mechanics of open-world games are often overlapped with ideas of sandbox games, but these are considered different concepts. Whereas open world refers to the lack of limits for the player&#39;s exploration of the game&#39;s world, sandbox games are based on the ability of giving the player tools for creative freedom within the game to approach objectives, if such objectives are present. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator is an open-world game as one can fly anywhere within the mapped world, but is not considered a sandbox game as there are few creative aspects brought into the game.[23]<br>The combination of open world and sandbox mechanics can lead towards emergent gameplay, complex reactions that emerge (either expectedly or unexpectedly) from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.[24] According to Peter Molyneux, emergent gameplay appears wherever a game has a good simulation system that allows players to play in the world and have it respond realistically to their actions. It is what made SimCity and The Sims compelling to players. Similarly, being able to freely interact with the city&#39;s inhabitants in Grand Theft Auto added an extra dimension to the series.[25]"

Most of his speeches have been translated into English since the end of the war. All it takes is an HONEST German to decipher them. I did my Grade 13 major English Essay on Adolph Hitler, and had ZERO problem getting his main speeches translated. That was in 1980. Lastly, in the past Amphetamines were as common as dirt. In North America as well as Germany. They were legal, &quot; over the counter&quot; drugs used in weight loss -- or as            a pick me up. They now know for certain that the German army used amphetamines extensively and were included in a soldiers &quot; first aid &quot; kit and were  commonly dolled out by &quot; the brass&quot;. Hitler obviously used them and was also a BIG fan of the new battlefield synthetic morphine --- called Demerol and had a German equivalent of &quot; Doctor Feelgood&quot;, also known as Hitlers personal physician. Kinda&#39; like Elvis had. &quot;Smoked up Joey&quot; needs a better investigative flunky, heck hes got a whole pile of &#39;em."

I have given consideration to when his mind began to become one of a violent dictator. I recommend looking into when his doctor became his doctor and when the murders actually started up. I think there is a correlation there. Which makes me worry so much about America allowing high psychological drugs like mushrooms being used as medicine. This is not the first time in history such things have been used by a long shot. From what i have seen about the things people start taking is that things that alter the mind so much make people insane and violent."

The British started the firebombing of German cities while the Nazis maintained a policy of targeting military personnel and equipment only!!! This fact seems to always disappear. After 4 months the Nazis responded in kind. How about the fact that the Nazis never wanted to go to war with the British and kept offering peace terms which Churchill would have none of. Germany invades Poland on September 1st, 1939 &amp; the USSR invaded Poland on September 17th, 1939 yet the French and British declare war on Germany but not on the USSR? The USSR had or will go on to invade Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and many more! In September of 1939 the Nazis have not yet started to murder people, the Communist at this point have already murdered between 40-50 million people! Yet, history tells us that the most evil regime ever had to be stopped no matter the cost and that&#39;s why we used terror to fight terror. Ever wonder what General Patton meant by saying we fought the wrong enemy?"

He started out with the right purpose, but went WAY overboard doing it with the meth. Yes,, Look it up. He could have been great until the meth took over him. Got paranoid and delusional as this drug does to ANYONE doing it. Now we have a much worse drug at our doorstep called Pentanal that is imported through our southern border and funded by george soros and the CCCP communist party. But so many Americans are so absorbed by the MSM propaganda that is funded by these people that they don&#39;t even know what they are doing by supporting these acts of treason. Can we forgive them for they know NOT what they do? Or should we call them out because it&#39;s all over the place what they do? I&#39;m torn.

I was just telling my son the other day how I also heard how he was this charismatic person who had learned how to speak &amp; people were were impressed with his speeches.  I said &#39;&#39;How scary is that-I wish they would interpret these so we can learn through the mistakes of past history instead of trying to just erase the entire thing.  Also+he invaded some of my ancestors as well. In no way am I advocating for his nonsense; even it had not affected my ancestors-It affected so many I am just curious as to how it was allowed to happen?????<br>     So many peopüòÆle forget that when that first record üéâ was shot out into space for &#39;aliens to find in hope they will understand us &amp; we will make &#39;contact-I think it was a gold record  or something that had famous composers &amp; messages from us......<br>     From what I learned much later in life is that Hitler gave a speech at the Olympics &amp; they included that on that record for the potential space aliens to find to learn about us. Imagine a far superior race of aliens out there finding this record which I wonder is it still floating around up there?  They would think we are so unintelligent that we are thinking this m¬£th head deserves to be included with things like Mozart &amp; Beethoven-which I am just guessing are some of the composers on there &amp; likely scientific formulas &amp; mathematics &amp; whatever we felt we knew....<br>     Anybody feel free to jump in &amp; ‚ù§‚ù§ we correct me if I got things wrong here because when I learned this years ago I thought &#39;No wonder we haven&#39;t made contact yet or If we did-We didn&#39;t know because there are so many secrets in g0‚úì¬£rnm3nt.<br>     I just want this to post.  So the fact I literally Said &#39;Why didn&#39;t they make a documentary about this &amp; teach us this so we can all learn from past mistakes &amp; then to hear he was on M3th toooooo?????? That makes A lot of sense.  Am I bugging out or in the beginning does it sound like he says Portugal?????  We can&#39;t just keep sweeping history under the rug &amp; only teaching what &#39;fits the agenda because then how will the younger generations ever learn to do better based on mistakes from the past.  It will just be a never ending cycle.  This was great to find but also scary-I&#39;m shaking &amp; clenching my own teeth Everytime I hear him<br>  Yet I did learn he was very charismatic &amp; learned that from one of the guys around him.  Which is to say then he was &#39;acting in order to be this charismatic knowing that charisma is very strong. <br>     I only learned in the last few years how he tried to take over Germany years before with just himself &amp; a bunch of of guys in a car &amp; literally tried to overthrow the government-With just a few people.  I am pretty sure there is an old black n&amp; white video of the actual event happening-unless it was just a re-enactment but for some reason I feel like I remember seeing him &amp; a bunch of his buddies in an old open top car then jumping out with their own flag &amp; trying to shoot out whatever military or power was currently in effect; I believe all his buddies were killed &amp; he was caught.<br> It&#39;s crazy he was released from those charges after some time because that would be treason against your country &amp; many high crimes I would think. <br>     Again-Anyone can correct me with the actual facts which is why we all needüòä to know.  He would have continued &amp; continued to take over more &amp; more Countries until he had taken over the world &amp; looking back seems like the An,√ó| Ch¬ßis+.  So we really need to make sure we don&#39;t show anyone to do this again yet it seems to already be going on.  Then sadly in the great country of U.S.A. That I love-We have had people in power that make it s scary place to live now too &amp; we need complete justice reform-healthcare reform-police reforn-Child protective care &amp; foster care reforn &amp; do much more.<br>     Isn&#39;t it time we stop just choosing from the same 2 parties &amp; somebody runs on an Independent &amp; we VOTE THEM IN.  When I did vote that was who I was mostly choosing but now I don&#39;t bother voting because there are things that bother me &amp; concerns me from both sides that it makes me sick. <br>     Also remember Charisma is what cult leaders have &amp; then song meth &amp; amphetamines to it &amp; Nobody catching on to that?????? So lets make sure we know proper history so we don&#39;t elect a meth addIc+.<br>    I think I said enough &amp; usually when I get to say anything that is important-in my mind-it disappears or never posts &amp; it gets soooo frustrating I feel usually day &#39;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23agghh\">#agghh</a> üòÆ Forget it-I guess it was not meant to be.  The fact that this came up in algorithm &amp; I didn&#39;t look for anything like this is really nuts.<br>    Have a Blessed Day."

But here‚Äôs a couple of more things he did‚Ä¶ invaded at least a half dozen countries and subjected them to Nazi rule for over a half decade and was responsible for the death of around 7 million people‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the equivalent of taking a ten of least populated states in this country and murdering every single man, woman, and child.

It&#39;s better than ever, and nobody feels any war at all. The only thing different is that some brands left, but we&#39;re quickly replaced/renamed into new brands doing the same thing. The economy is growing, the cities are getting better by the day, the city I am in is a third bigger than when I visited pre war. This is a 1m person city.

I also had a geometry teacher in high school in the mid 1990s who was born in Austria and fought in the war. He told us stories about it after tests on Fridays. Both of them said the same things about how the Nazis gained and kept power and what really happened, especially prior to Nazi control during the inflation era. Their old-style interpretation of how things were at the time were not propaganda reiterations, but simply how one thing led to another. World War 1 caused the destruction of cities, which destroyed the banks, which destroyed all the physical cash (their only source of money, as credit and digital currency didn&#39;t exist then as we know it today). Then there was an influx of immigrants and Jews which was intended to bring in foreign money and successful businesses to rebuild the country. Because all the cash was gone, people couldn&#39;t buy anything, so cash had to be made quickly and distributed even faster because of the high demand. As soon as a bank got cash, people would line out the doors to get a share, but everyone was given a maximum permissable amount, but not the amount they asked for, as the banks didn&#39;t have enough cash to give enough to anybody because of low supply. Eventually, the supply was greater than the demand and the greedy companies owned by foreigners and Jews increased the prices so high because the supply of cash was so plentiful. So people needed to be paid more money, and thus more money had to be printed. The inflation continued to soar. So the abuse of the financial system in Germany at that time was actually caused by the Jews and foreigners, so all of them were hated by native Germans. By the time the Nazis came around, the whole country was already quite ant¬∞semitic. The Nazis wanted to give fair pay to the people, invest in native German owned businesses, limit the greed and reduce inflation, etc. Their aggressive plan worked for the most part, but the cancellation of the Jews through each step kept getting worse and worse. It&#39;s so sad. My mom is Jewish, so her side of the family saw a lot of loss. We look at the Holocaust and the war and hate the Nazis for it, and there&#39;s a good point to that. But what caused the whole country to follow this corrupt political party? Was it propaganda, or was it because everyone already felt the same way about a big problem affecting their people, especially when it came from migrants? Imagine being an American today, with the illegal immigrants coming in, whether they brought in crime or money. Let&#39;s say they started businesses that caused major inflation because of the need for more money and employment demands. That affects the whole country negatively. We are seeing massive inflation here. The same things that happened to Germany in the 1920s through 40s are happening here now, and it&#39;s caused by the liberals who want to bring on a similar Nazi party that first crushes the economy, only to rebuild it to look like heroes, then blame certain people (whites) for the problems and exterminate them. The racism against whites now is the same as it was against the Jews then. There are so many noticable parallels that it&#39;s scary. It will only lead to the same thing, and that&#39;s even scarier, and it&#39;s so wrong and evil, just like the Nazis were evil"

            "text": "The funny thing about it all is that the laws that Hitler and Nazi Germany had passed match up with what the Democratic Party is doing here in the USA. Think about it for a second and hear me out. Hitler used the Treaty of Versailles as a way to promote victimhood. For those who don‚Äôt know, the Treaty of Versailles was what ended WW1 and Germany had to accept the terms or the Allies would not agree to it. What the Treaty of Versailles said as it affected Germany was that Germany had to accept full responsibility for WW1, and had to pay for all damages from WW1 in order for the war to end. Personally, I find that incredibly unfair to Germany, but also incredibly stupid of the Allied Forces. I mean what did they expect to happen? It sent Germany into a depression, and created a sense of animosity in the German citizens, which allowed Hitler to gain power via victimhood. Now, the Jews were already discriminated against in Germany at the time much like black people were discriminated against in the USA. When someone much like Obama and Biden come into the picture promising those who openly felt wronged they would obviously vote for him. If Hitler would have died in 1938 he would have been remembered as the greatest leader of all time. However, that didn‚Äôt happen. Then the Nuremberg Laws were passed giving preferential treatment to German citizens and taking rights and privileges away from Jewish civilians much like Affirmative Action here in the USA. If you read old text books from before the No Child Left Behind Act, the definitions of Nazism, Fascism, and Marxism has changed. Most people know these forms of government are bad but they can‚Äôt even say why anymore. They just label people those things and say they are bad people."

Of course when questioned about this yrs later it was said ‚Äúbc he ordered Japan to attack‚Äù yep that was their justification for going into Germany ‚ÄúBS‚Äù that did not happen. American was doing the same types of thing they accused Hitler of doing. They locked up anyone who was Asian looking even Hawaiians into camps, they did sterilization on the mentally ill, they did experiments on their own military officers, blacks, etc, they did horrible things during the war too, in Vietnam women were graped, etc they didn‚Äôt go into Germany bc of what Hitler was doing or wasn‚Äôt doing they went in there bc Britain‚Äôs and America were afraid of the power Hitler had and all the stuff he was taking over.

He first mentioned this when he wrote his book saying that ‚Äùthe most humane way to deal with them is death by gas‚Äú. With the Nuremberg laws in 1935 their rights were decimated but they were not actively killed yet. The whole idea of ‚Äùthe final solution‚Äú became prominent around 1940. Because the actual main idea was to forcefully move all European Jews to Madagascar. However due to British naval supremacy that became impossible. In June 1940, Herman G√∂ring tasked Heydrich to come up with a new plan. This plan became more and more brutal and complicated as the Einsatzgruppen were already actively killing Jews while the Wehrmacht was advancing into Soviet territory in Operation Barbarossa. Heydrich finalized his plan which would then result in Holocaust. Luckily he was assassinated around 1941"

Who invented gulags kgb and more. And are responsible for more genocide than any other entity in the history of mankind. <br><br>One got rid of the tyranny that was starving his people and brought prominence to his people, and the other took over a nation that didn‚Äôt belong to them and committed genocide to anybody who didn‚Äôt agree with the ruling.<br><br>I am not saying that Jew did not suffer in Germany, or that they were not arrested or held in prison because they were. But it wasn‚Äôt because they were simply Jewish. It was because 90% of the communist Jewish. And there‚Äôs evidence proving that. Scientist who visited documented the information accordingly. There were Jewish people locked up, but that they were communist and the majority of the communist that were in there in the Jewish. 17 of the 19 leadership of Russian bolsheviks were jewish. This isnt hate its just factual info. And it must be discussed. <br>They are the only people that live around the world who do not assimilate to the host nations. European nations, open borders and diversity, even within couples. Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. However, there is hypocrisy because of Israel you have to be pure blood to be a citizen.. you have to have two Jewish grandparents. And get married one has to be at least full blooded and the other minimum half. They have a wall around the whole country like midevil times and refuse to diversify because it will ruin their country they say. So tell me what‚Äôs different for other nations? <br><br>Hitler also did not have a master race plan Jews do. So what you find Hitler did was having agreement with Jews and practice their own rules for German people. So explain why is it OK for Jewish people to practice racial purity but not anybody else."

            "text": "What happened to Germany started in WW1. The Bad war. England and France didn‚Äôt like Germany growth emerging as a super power 1871. <br>Germany honoring a defensive pact with Austria/hungry only wanted peace. When Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in cold blood by a young muslim started a war. <br>For whatever reasons bankers didn‚Äôt want to back England and France in that war because they backed the Tsar of Russia. Who was the Cousin of the king of England. England &amp; France decided to back Serbia, so Germany stepped in to even the odds. Well, england called their cousin Nicholas in Russia to join in on a 4v2. Long story short, Germany kicked all their asses. The Russian Tsar Limped back to Russia only to find out that the Marxist Communist he just exiled in a 1905 coup came back and took over in the Bolshevik rebellion 1917 backed by Jacob Schiff (jewish German born American banker)  J‚Äôs around the world celebrated their brethren takeover of Russia with Trotsky and Lenin.  Marxism/Communism was birthed by the synagogue of Satan. The first act passed by the Bolsheviks was the antisemitism act. Hate crime punishable by 10 years in a gulag. They then proceeded to kill approximately 30 million Slavic Russians, and Christians. <br>At this time, all the papers and news reels were pro German. Nothing but good things to say. Who owns all the papers? Who owns all the media who owns all the banks? Who is the one race of human beings you‚Äôre not allowed to criticize for immoral acts, becauseimmoral because they have a catch phrase to scare you calling you racist? I‚Äôll give you one guess on who the Bolshevik leadership was‚Ä¶.DYOR‚Ä¶ <br>After the abdication of the Russian Tsar, who was murdered like a dog with his family by the Bolsheviks, Germany had defeated France and England. The war was effectively over. Frances Army mutinied and England was out of ammo and only had a half season of food. <br><br>What did Germany do? Germany offered everybody peace. to go back to the original lines and call it good and let the war be over. This is what Kaiser offered. At that moment, Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolow (zionist) approached England and offered to bring the US into the war, in trade for Britain to give them the Ottoman Turks Palestine. This was the Balfour declaration to deer Lord Rothschild‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. <br>What this means is 10 million American boys went to war, fought, bleed, and died For Zionist to get their hands on Palestine illegally through war. During the signing of the treaty of Versailles, the allies were raping Germany, splitting up her lands as spoils of war. This is where Germany learned they were betrayed by the Jews. They took in from Russia that were expelled during the communist revolution of 1905. They took them in as refugees. And they had their best life in Germany. Became prominent bankers and businessman. The German Kaiser, then left Germany fear of the communist to Germany what they did to Russia. So he left to Holland. And the communist did come. Three days Germany before Hitler took it over as a German nationalist. At this point. Germany was starving from the restrictions placed on them after WW1, everybody remembered what the communist did. Hitler got elected overwhelmingly, the world‚Äôs jewry met and had a meeting, and announced via the papers and media in 1933 a holy war against Germany. They demanded that all of their Jewish counterparts be placed back into power, regardless of if they were communist or not. You know what Hitler said. 1933 was well before the war or any imprisonment of communist Jews. If you do a timeline of events, you will see the truth. The story of World War II is fiction. In the 29 crash all countries were doing horrible under banking circumstances, Germany was doing really well. Churchill, FDR and others are interesting people and you should follow their lineage. Eisenhower too. There is a reason that the magical number of 6 million on the plaque of Auschwitz has been reduced to merely 1 million. The fact is that the communist choose in the camps were never killed and gas chambers that don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs been proven by science. And World War II Hitler just took German lands that were stripped of them from World War I. The communist bolsheviks took over poland Auschwitz, changing certain things for propaganda. Chimney to the building in question. Which is an optical illusion because it‚Äôs not even attached to the building. It‚Äôs behind it on the ground. The chamber door is made of wood with a window with the lock on the inside were supposedly the Jews were gassed. The truth is zyclon B was used for delousing. Like the United States did on the border of Mexico to the Mexicans in the 20s. Look it up. Same chems. Witnesses from being locked up in German camps not Russian camps, said that the Germans took good care of them until operation thunderclap (claimed to not have happened) killing 100‚Äôs of thousands or civilians women, children, elderly with incendiary bombs all over civilian populations of not just Berlin, but other cities and towns. They bombed and burned alive civilians non combatants. Kind of like what the Americans did to Japan with and Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead of that scale, they used bombing carpet style.. after the war, the allied powers split up Germany creating a wall in Berlin so the Germans could never grow in strength again. On the east side of the communist bolsheviks had power raping/killing women and sending everyone to gulags. In the west what was left of the civilian population of women were selling themselves to American in British forces to make men meet to feed themselves and their families. Eisenhower held the POWS in the Rhine, in camps. he reclassified them as DEF‚Äôs(disarmed enemy forces) and therefore they were not protected by the Geneva convention, and so he held them in the camps with no water or food and many died. More German soldiers died after the war then during. To put perspective on the camps.. supposed Jewish concentration camps were inducing death camps, but in reality they had swimming pools and orchestras like Auschwitz. When you translate Hitler‚Äôs speeches, he sounds more like a person with national pride who wants to put Germany first. Sound familiar. I‚Äôm afraid gentlemen we have been lied to."

Atp with all the hidden information that has been revealed and continually being revealed Hitler was a General in YAH army. Idk all the specifics to his reign but what i do know is he was removing the fake jews the &quot;jew-ish&quot; people off the map and the holocaust was NOT Duteuronomy 28! Raped killed hung from trees!  That part. That wasnt them at all. They were being gass chambered thrown in &quot;ghettos&quot; no hangings none of thay straight gas chambers and gun downs! Yea them people may have not necessarily done anything but be serpent children on satan and not one time in the word of ELOHIM do I see The Most High YAH make Yashar&#39;EL stop detroying an enemy nation because of age or gender innocence. Hitler knew the real 1s were of heavy melanated complexion during the fleeing from romes oppression back then. They wasnt the real1s! Just like the ones in Israel are not today! I said it its actual factual. Russia just threw a monkey ranch into the whole shit with the heavy melanated paintings of JEWS from back then! Hitler was kinda puttin in work in YAH army knockin down satans seed like Yahusha called em serpents! Pharisees and Saducee ass people who didnt even believe or know for that matter YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH they was still waitin on a King smh they called The Mashiach powers  powers from satan in the bible. Hitler was tearin they children asses up! The word say what u do in this world your children will suffer from. Holocaust was not Deteronomy 28! It was serpent children extinction. Facts! Thats why the world all f&#39;d up now with Semitic and anti Semitic debates about if the hebrews are heavily melanated and about color you got the Christians sayim its not however if it wasnt then they woulda never start making false paintings and turning historical shit white! They woulda just left truth alone! The Vatican would be an open museum! That part"

The rhetoric very strongly resembles much of the rhetoric on the right today. It particularly resembled the xenophobia. The blaming of one vulnerable group of people for all the ills of a particular nation. Mark Twain was right. ‚ÄúHistory does not repeat itself butt, it rhymes.‚Äù as for my impressions of his speaking style? Terrifyingly effective. The man was a veritable Saraman The White. In fact, it was such a Stark paralel of that character that I wonder whether or not Tolkien was thinking of H1tler when he came up with it. He <br>was a linguist after all. It would not surprise me if he could understand him in the original. You can only clearly see how crazy he is when you cannot understand the words coming out of his mouth. You do not have to know what he did in order to realize that somebody maniacal is before you. Once you understand his words though, you fall under his spell and you can fool yourself into thinking that he was actually quite sane. It was one of the most disturbing seven minutes of my life."

Don&#39;t listen to the speeches they want you to hear, listen to the whispers of policy. Policies differ heavily from whats promised in speeches."

We all have choices but sometimes life gets in the way and we become something than was wanted to be in the first place. <br>Hitler did not inspire to be a mass idiot who wanted to kill millions. AGAIN HITLER WAS A MASS IDIOT BECAUSE OF HATE, AND RACISM. NO GO. ANYWHO LOL he wanted to become a painter and spent time to become an artist.but got shut down.(To me his art wasn&#39;t bad, but no one gave him a chance.)  He then tried to sell his paintings on the street he was hungry and poor. Hungry and poor is a recipe for desperation for most people. <br>So much more to say but as I close yes Hitler was is and will always be wrong. But how he became Hitler wasn&#39;t his first choice and his speeches tell you what he wanted for his people. He went wrong with blaming a whole race and killing them. Other than that if he didn&#39;t use racism to fuel peoples anger and truly United all of Germany from white, black, gimpsy, Jews, Christians etc. then we mightve been talking about how great he was.

Thats what makes Populists dangerous. If they said what their goals were, they wouldnt have support. Another thing is that people dont believe they would actually do the things they say. While that is exactly what those populists are going to do. H1tler talked abt his hatred for jews in his book already, peoplw didnt take him seriously. He was assgined high positions in hopes that he would grow with them and not follow his proclaimed goals. They were wrong.

            "text": "I think taking one clip from one speech and making conclusions is in fact an assumption. And assumptions are the mother of all fcuk ups. This is an extract from the Speech by Adolf Hitler to the Reichtag January 30, 1939. <br><br>1. &quot;We,&quot; that is the democracies, &quot;are not in a position to take in the Jews.&quot; Yet in these empires there are not 10 people to the square kilometer. While Germany, with her 135 inhabitants to the square kilometer, is supposed to have room for them!<br><br>2. They assure us: We cannot take them unless Germany is prepared to allow them a certain amount of capital to bring with them as immigrants.<br><br>For hundreds of years Germany was good enough to receive these elements, although they possessed nothing except infectious political and physical diseases. What they possess today, they have by a very large extent gained at the cost of the less astute German nation by the most reprehensible manipulations.<br><br>Today we are merely paying this people what it deserves. When the German nation was, thanks to the inflation instigated and carried through by Jews, deprived of the entire savings which it had accumulated in years of honest work, when the rest of the world took away the German nation&#39;s foreign investments, when we were divested of the whole of our colonial possessions, these philanthropic considerations evidently carried little noticeable weight with democratic statesmen.<br><br>Today I can only assure these gentlemen that, thanks to the brutal education with which the democracies favored us for fifteen years, we are completely hardened to all attacks of sentiment. After more than eight hundred thousand children of the nation had died of hunger and undernourishment at the close of the War, we witnessed almost one million head of milking cows being driven away from us in accordance with the cruel paragraphs of a dictate which the humane democratic apostles of the world forced upon us as a peace treaty. We witnessed over one million German prisoners of war being retained in confinement for no reason at all for a whole year after the War was ended. We witnessed over one and a half million Germans being torn away from all that they possessed in the territories lying on our frontiers, and being whipped out with practically only what they wore on their backs. We had to endure having millions of our fellow countrymen torn from us without their consent, and without their being afforded the slightest possibility of existence. I could supplement these examples with dozens of the most cruel kind. For this reason we ask to be spared all sentimental talk. The German nation does not wish its interests to be determined and controlled by any foreign nation. France to the French, England to the English, America to the Americans, and Germany to the Germans. We are resolved to prevent the settlement in our country of a strange people which was capable of snatching for itself all the leading positions in the land, and to oust it. For it is our will to educate our own nation for these leading positions. We have hundreds of thousands of very intelligent children of peasants and of the working classes. We shall have them educated -  in fact we have already begun and we wish that one day they, and not the representatives of an alien race, may hold the leading positions in the State together with our educated classes. Above all, German culture, as its name alone shows, is German and not Jewish, and therefore its management and care will be entrusted to members of our own nation. If the rest of the world cries out with a hypocritical mien against this barbaric expulsion from Germany of such an irreplaceable and culturally eminently valuable element, we can only be astonished at the conclusions they draw from this situation. For how thankful they must be that we are releasing these precious apostles of culture, and placing them at the disposal of the rest of the world. In accordance with their own declarations they cannot find a single reason to excuse themselves for refusing to receive this most valuable race in their own countries. Nor can I see a reason why the members of this race should be imposed upon the German nation, while in the States, which are so enthusiastic about these &quot;splendid people,&quot; their settlement should suddenly be refused with every imaginable excuse. I think that the sooner this problem is solved the better; for Europe cannot settle down until the Jewish question is cleared up. It may very well be possible that sooner or later an agreement on this problem may be reached in Europe, even between those nations which otherwise do not so easily come together.<br><br>The world has sufficient space for settlements, but we must once and for all get rid of the opinion that the Jewish race was only created by God for the purpose of being in a certain percentage a parasite living on the body and the productive work of other nations. The Jewish race will have to adapt itself to sound constructive activity as other nations do, or sooner or later it will succumb to a crisis of an inconceivable magnitude.<br><br>One thing I should like to say on this day which may be memorable for others as well as for us Germans: In the course of my life I have very often been a prophet, and have usually been ridiculed for it. During the time of my struggle for power it was in the first instance the Jewish race which only received my prophecies with laughter when I said that I would one day take over the leadership of the State, and with it that of the whole nation, and that I would then among many other things settle the Jewish problem. Their laughter was uproarious, but I think that for some time now they have been laughing on the other side of their face. Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!<br><br>...The nations are no longer willing to die on the battlefield so that this unstable international race may profiteer from a war or satisfy its Old Testament vengeance. The Jewish watchword &quot;Workers of the world unite&quot; will be conquered by a higher realization, namely &quot;Workers of all classes and of all nations, recognize your common enemy!&quot;<br><br>N.H.

Hell, even the Klan scene in Django, however funny and cathartic that was, It served to humanize them and diminished what their intentions were. Not the focus of the movie, but they weren&#39;t a bunch of clowns they were murderers of innocent children lest we forget, just as Adolph Hitler was. The English translation of this speech is as old as the speech itself. However fascism is on the rise, and this helps. I wonder if there will ever be a movie produced or documents uncovered that depict Ho Chi Minh as a simple misunderstood farmer. Or Muammar Gaddafi as a humanitarian leader.

That‚Äôs not to say that Hitler‚Äôs motives were entirely cold blooded. For there are many other events, during the first part of the 20th century, which will clearly lead any good researcher to the horrific outcomes of Nazi Germany, many which are rarely talked about, I imagine because it‚Äôs easier to point the finger at Hitler than shoulder any shared responsibility for creating a mad man hell bent on wiping out a race. War however has no perspective and rarely creates any long lasting resolutions. While there are those who exist with more than they will ever need and others sleep in rat infested shanty towns there will never be any resolution.

Hitler was never on Meth or any other drugs until 1944. That clip of Hitler rotating in his seat, was taken at the Olympic games in Germany. The Germans who viewed that footage purposely kept the public from seeing it. The only drugs Hitler was being given were in 1944 until the end of his life. They were mostly a cocktail of prescribed drugs to keep him awake &amp; alert as well as to control his depression. By 1944, Germany had burned through over 2 million German troops, &amp; they were losing on all fronts. Hitler was prone to nervous breakdowns daily"

What annoyed Hitler seems to be both the Political corruption that caused the fall of Prussia during the Napoleonic wars and the political corruption that made Germans suffer from great depression that forced many Germans to become violent revolutionaries known as Nazi&#39;s. Also i don&#39;t really believe the potato famine was not deliberately caused by such corrupt politicians that fled to France to send many French to die as foolish puppets during the battle of Trafalgar which was a tragic friendly fire accident between the united empire of clan wallace and their french allies of the old alliance of Scotland."

Especially if the subject brings out the level of emotion that Hitler does. In my experience I have discovered that <br>Almost everyone knows in great detail the suffering the Jews experienced in the hands of the Nazis, and that is about it! <br>&quot;History&quot; has taught us almost nothing more about Hitler and the Nazis party, like why did so many Germans love him (and he wasn&#39;t just loved by Germans) but he was loved by many! Or why did they have so much animosity towards the Jewish people? <br>But our history only teaches us the horrible things he did to the Jews. And they came up with a phrase that nobody wants pinned on them for simply asking questions. The wrong questions about the Holocaust or not having any other feelings but hatred towards Hitler and you will be labeled a Antisemitic and that label is the worst thing to be labeled.<br>In the light of the recent events since 2020<br>We have seen the ugly head of government overreach and the level in which it is willing to go. We also have seen how ALL governments work together in lockstep against it&#39;s own people.

I don&#39;t see history. I see propaganda! And I now question exactly what really happened? I&#39;m 100%<br>Convinced that we are being lied to about Hitler and the Holocaust. And when I see the way Israel is treating the entire Palestinian<br>People, woman and children too, I have to question how can they do that! How can a people who just recently suffered through violence and murder just for being Jewish people, how can they turn around and do the exact same thing to another entire group of people? And it&#39;s not the people who did that to them. It&#39;s the people who took them in when they had nowhere to go BECAUSE of the treatment by the Germans! <br>.. can anyone make this make sense?"

As they even asked yelling the audience for example: &quot;Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?!&quot; -&gt; &quot;Do you want the total war?!&quot; (Which was one of their campaigning to get every single individual including kids and woman involved in the war to fight and kill everyone that they don&#39;t like and isn&#39;t &quot;Aryan&quot; enough for them, so that they kill and defeat everybody in the shortest time possible. One of their another slogans was even &quot;Totaler Krieg = K√ºrzester Krieg&quot; -&gt; Total war = shortest war&quot; They had been ready and willingful threw all in to kill every single soul that didn&#39;t went along their lines and politics.) Also Hitler wasn&#39;t THAT dumb, of cause he knew how to talk to the masses and push them/hype them in a state to make and keep them believe that he is their right leader to make the German Reich superior and above anything else. Aside that his fellow men like Goebbels worked along with him to have aligned speeches that would gain the mass for them. Hitler had of cause also been using his history being in the war that is now known as World War One, idolizing himself to a godlike F√ºhrer (Leader) whereas in reality his war involvement was very short, as his war records show, since he got wounded and sent back home crippled at that time, as even prior his commanding officers knew and reported him as a useless person for the war, that isn&#39;t any good in the sense as a soldier and that he&#39;s nothing more than a nutcase that shouldn&#39;t had been there in the first place according to them. He was even risking the other soldiers life, like giving repeatingly their position away and risking his life stupidly by doing stupid things on his own, instead listening to orders by commanding officers, that followed a plan to keep their troops alive and bring them home safely while trying also to defeat the enemy with a plan, rather than just running around like squirrels that are nuts and keep shooting and wasting bullets into the nothing, when there wasn&#39;t even an enemy at sight, while trying to make himself a hero. Also since when couldn&#39;t those speeches be translated?! Everybody who speaks English and German can translate those. There&#39;s no modern technology required and there is nothing knew on that that we didn&#39;t had before. That just goes to show again how uneducated Joe Rogan&#39;s Podcast is and how often it&#39;s spreading lies and false information, which happen way to often on his Podcast."
