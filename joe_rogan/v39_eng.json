As a builder that developed insomnia in my teens, if i was impaired during my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s  then i would have been a juggernaut on 8hrs. Instead I would feel lethargic and fuzzy. I would do 9hr days, 6 days a week and sometimes miss sleep cycles due to parties on weekends or gta san andreas on week days. Downside is i might sleep 10hrs straight once every 6 months if uninterupted. Less than 4hrs a night for 2 weeks straight i would show a decline."

A handful of us, well everyone that could and realized how awesome this way, continued for years or still do today, more than a decade later. I only stopped when i nearly broke my neck, fractured and eventually fused c1-5 vertebrae, bc that completely messed me up, in many ways, incl sleep. But nearly 1.5 years later, I just started again and although a little more difficult these first few days, its definitely working again, although with considerably more effort this time around (bc of many factors)."

I was a meth addict for 10 years, from 1985 to 1995 during that time I had several episodes where I would stay up for anywhere from 5 to 8 days in a row. I&#39;m not going to try to lie or trick you into believing they didn&#39;t affect me, you bet your ass it did, psychologically emotionally physically it affected me. I got clean in 1995. I started college in 1996. I took a full load while working 25 hours a week. I won academic achievement awards and was on the president&#39;s list for all three years earning 108 credits while I did my associate&#39;s degree. I want a scholarship and a full ride to my bachelor&#39;s program. I also became morbidly obese and developed to sleep apnea. During that time I work 20 hours a week in the library carried a full load and averaged about 7 hours of sleep a night with sleep apnea so you can do the math there I was probably averaging 3 and 1/2 hours of sleep. Did it affect me? You bet it did. Nevertheless, I maintained a 3.93 GPA graduated summa cum laude and earned a full ride scholarship to my master&#39;s program while I was married and co-parenting three stepchildren. I entered my master&#39;s program still morbidly obese at well over 350 lbs. Fathered a child and maintain a 3.92 GPA while carrying a full load and classes and teaching four classes per term averaging less than 6 hours of sleep per night with sleep apnea when it finally under went a sleep study and was put on a CPAP machine which helped tremendously. I maintained my GPA at 3.92 retook my graduate record examination and earned a full ride scholarship to my PhD program While co-parenting three step children helping to raise my newborn daughter and matriculating through my master&#39;s program. I answered my PhD program at 390 lbs. Carrying a full load of courses teaching as a graduate teaching assistant maintaining a 3.91 GPA when I began to have panic attacks. Was the lack of sleep affecting me, yes it was was being married to a shrieking harpy affecting me, yes it was. Was being morbidly obese affecting me? Yes it was was being a closeted transgender individual for the previous 30 years affecting me Yes it was. Nevertheless I maintained my GPA got through my academic studies and took my graduate exams and passed had bariatric surgery and lost 140 lb got on medication for my panic attacks and got my dissertation prospectus approved and moved the family back to Oregon. Went through a divorce, couldn&#39;t find a job as a professor and became an entrepreneur worked 80 hours a week averaging 5 to 6 hours of sleep at night maximum for 9 years. Stop having a panic attacks though because I was no longer married to that shrinking harpie. Started a new business, work 80 hours a week to build that and after 3 years I began my transition and the 70 lb I had gained back I lost again and I&#39;ve been averaging slightly less than 6 hours of sleep per night the whole time sure there are times when I sleep in but it&#39;s usually because I&#39;m sick like with a severe cold or something but now I&#39;m 60 years old and has the lack of sleep affected me I don&#39;t know maybe maybe not but I run two successful businesses I have a genius IQ I&#39;m happy and we&#39;ll adjusted I have a memory that&#39;s as sharp as attack so you tell me, or some people just able to endure with less sleep than others. I think they are. But you got to follow your own path and listen to your body when it says rest, you better rest or you&#39;re going to pay for it. I&#39;m slowing down now, I don&#39;t feel the urge desire or compulsion to only sleep 6 hours sometimes it&#39;s just works out that way. What&#39;s a girl going to do?"

A person can sleep 7-9 hours and still wake up impaired because there&#39;s a specific time we should wake up at which is when the sleep cycle is over. A sleep cycle is 1.5 hours so if you sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 11:30 pm you will wake up feeling great. The same goes when you wake up at 3 hours of sleep or 4.5 or 6 or 7.5 or 9. However, of course everyone would sleep 1.5 hours if they&#39;re gonna wake up feeling great anyways. Well, the more sleep cycles you have the longer your &quot;feeling great&quot; state will last. If you sleep 1.5 hours you will be good for 2 hours then you will shut down. If you sleep 9 hours you&#39;ll stay fresh the whole day."

However, I don‚Äôt think we still know if this is sustainable or not, meaning, if this changes with age since some genes do change and when you are 60 if this has chronic or acute byproducts due to say not getting as much of the other parts of the sleep cycle or simply not resting overall as much. It‚Äôs very hard to know for sure.

There&#39;s definitely a huge difference in how well you function due to how well you&#39;ve slept and for how long you&#39;ve slept. In the odd chance I get a full night of sleep 6-7 hours I feel fantastic compared to 4-5 hours. Before I used to get worried when I got little sleep as I felt I couldn&#39;t function properly at work etc. but as I&#39;ve gotten used to it over the years I don&#39;t really care about terrible nights anymore. I do my important stuff early and go to bed early in the evening instead.

We ended up going to the same college together on the East Coast and we put the paperwork in to become roommates and he did the same thing. He would always go to bed at 12 wake up at four and read in his bed I never saw him take naps during the day or anything. He eventually decided to go to medical school and he matched into neurosurgery and basically he said it is my strength, so I might as well capitalize on it and help people. he says most people in his line of work only sleep maybe 5 or 6 hours a night and they have to continue to operate as usual.

It might cause slight performance issues but not noticeable. The key words are survive and with 0 impairment. Getting 1-3 5 hour sleep nights won‚Äôt kill you. Doing it for 3 months straight with 0 naps and 0 8 hour sleep days will decimate pretty much anyone. There have been so many studies at this point on sleep deprivation that it blows my mind people think they are the special outlier. If you are volunteer for a sleep deprivation study and you will realize how untrue that is after 3 months on no more than 5 monitored hours of sleep per day. Recently had a dude who claimed he slept 5-6 hours of sleep per day. He did a study. It turns out his avg sleep was 7 hours per day. He would sleep 5 hours a day 5 days a week and 8-10 hours on his days off work. After 3 weeks into the study he quit."
