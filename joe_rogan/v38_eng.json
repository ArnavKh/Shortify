I hope and pray that He will know Jesus personally so that everything with him is perfect. That’s the most important thing in life is to know Jesus as your personal Savior. When I was going through so much difficulty with my new found sickness Diabetes which gives me so much stress and anxiety but when I surrendered everything to Jesus and I told Him I’m ready to be with Him anytime, I felt very good. My anxiety and depression went away including my fear of death. I am 71 years old now so I told the Lord that if He is finished with me meaning I have done my purpose in this life I would like to be with Him. Then, suddenly I felt good like I didn’t have Diabetes. I will only know that when I go for my physical check up but, whether I still have it or not I am sure that God heard my cry. He took all the worried and stress even fear of death. I welcome death now and the future of being in heaven with the Lord forever. He took a load off my mind and my chest. Jesus Christ is my Lord, Savior, and God. Satan’s hold on me is gone. His torture of my mind couldn’t handle the faith that God through Jesus Christ gave me. ALL PRAISE AND THANK TO JESUS. I don’t fear death anymore."

Or when you are 4 years old and your uncle that’s (sober) is allowed to watch you and your siblings for the night while your parents attend an AA meeting because your father has been an alcoholic his entire life up to that point, and that night you find out your uncle is not sober anymore he went to the store to get candy and he got beer and a movie,he wanted me to<br>Watch it with him, it was called “Child’s Play” (Chucky part 1) and it scared you so much that you slept next to your parents bed until you were 12 years old. Or a father that beat the shit out of you and made you lick piss off of a toilet seat . Or how about years later when you are about 15 years old and the uncle that made you watch a horror movie with him shows up to your home completely at the end of his rope and strung out and sleeping out back of our property in a trailer and one night steals my sisters car (who is like 19 years old) and drives it to west palm beach and commits suicide in a hotel.

We watched an SR71 Blackbird takeoff, and and hour or so later land.  Every one of knew what was going on; Vietnam was falling, and we were awaiting the film development before we got orders for the flight.

That intense feeling came over everyone, and you no one was speaking.  Then the roll began to the runway... and hell opened it&#39;s mouth to devour us all."

Our body needs to suffer hardship unless we become what we are now: stupid religious people fighting the other,  believing bogus conspiracies, unable to recognize the real dangers.

It took me 27 years to change my ways for the better and I learned to suppress all my anger and smile instead of flipping on that switch. I used to be one of the biggest dope boys in my state not just my town or city. And as well as a gang banger my roots run deep in the streets. I put all that behind me it was hard to do but I did it. God has his ways of changing people who can&#39;t or won&#39;t do it by themselves. God&#39;s plan was to give me a child, I never wanted any kids but always said if I had any id be a man and be a father to it, my son is now 10 years old I&#39;m 11 years sober from alcohol. And I put my flag down and got blessed out to become a family man. And I get selling and thuggin and druggin and drinking, i got a year clean from heroin I ain&#39;t been in not fights or shoot outs in about 4 years, so in all honesty I&#39;m very happy with what I have overcome and the man I&#39;ve become. If I can do it anyone can. I started when I was 11 years old gang banging selling drugs became a full blow heroin addict all that shit. I started smoking weed and cigarettes when I was 8 mad by the time I was 11 I was doing everything on a daily basis. And the bad part about it is I looked 21 22 when I was 11. So I never got carded for any cigs or alcohol everyone that was 16 to 20 came to me to buy there shit cause they got carded but a 11 year old kid built like a brick shit house looking 22 at 11 can get anything. It&#39;s a sad sad world we live in.. The moral of the story is that people can change for the better. You just gotta want it yourself"

He knew the Deep State Establishment had been using our country and its wealth for their own personal gain and power for over a century. He volunteered to go through Hell for us and to save the country they gave him opportunity more than he could have ever wished for.  The real American Dream, which has been dismantled for the rest of us over the last several decades. <br><br>Ironically, he could even still stop the attacks and legal issues, but he refuses to surrender.

I also went to therapy and Thank God that helped my PTSD!  I sank lower than rock bottom, and I didn’t think that was possible.  I was the n a depression because of my mom putting me down.  I could not go on living.  I gave up and said Lord if you want me dead and take everything from me then so be it, I can’t continue.<br>I literally prayed for God to take me!!  Then God gave me an out of body experience and healed my heart.  And just like the demons of depression were gone.  I praise God.

He was going to be beaten, whipped, scorned and mocked. He was going to be crucified and die an excruciating death. Jesus was going to be partially separated from the Father. <br><br>Jesus paid it all. Not some. ALL. The worst sins ever committed, the worst people you can think of and what they’ve done. The guilt and shame you carry, the suffering you’ve endured and what your loved ones have endured, Jesus took all these sins upon Himself and took the wrath of God upon Himself so you wouldn’t have to pay the price of death for your sins. <br><br>Suffering leads to Jesus. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Yet while Jesus being God, He became flesh to dwell among us. He lived the life we should have lived, and He died a death that we deserved. God knows your suffering because He suffered the worst of us all. <br><br>He is the ultimate Truth and the only path to eternal life. Please I beg you. Put your faith in Jesus and you will see Him. You will know the forgiving and ultimate love of Jesus when you realize what Jesus did for you. Jesus is looking upon you now. I know you might’ve been thinking it. He is, and He loves you. He loves you so much. You, who is reading this- you don’t need to live in your bondage anymore. You can be free of your fears, your dark thoughts, all your sins washed away by Jesus. <br><br><br><br>Just open the door to Him. I pray peace, love, courage and Truth into your life of all who has read this far. I love you and Jesus loves you."

Very often people who&#39;ve been seriously traumatized become withdrawn, depressed, they don&#39;t trust people, they&#39;re super cautious about the smallest things... Seriously this misinformation that hard times creates a stronger man is very infuriating. It&#39;s simply not true at all. There are plenty of tough guys who had a great life, and there are plenty of broken men who can&#39;t stand up for themselves due to horrific trauma that was put on them. We don&#39;t use blanket ideas like that for something so complex as how the human brain and <i>&quot;soul&quot;</i> reacts to severe trauma."

When individuals face significant challenges or hardships, they are forced to adapt and develop new skills or ways of thinking. Here are a few reasons why this may happen:<br><br>\t1.\tBuilding Resilience: Overcoming difficulties can help individuals develop resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity. Each challenge provides an opportunity to strengthen this trait.<br>\t2.\tProblem-solving skills: Difficult situations often require unique or out-of-the-box solutions. People who have faced such situations may develop superior problem-solving abilities as they’ve had to strategize and navigate their way through challenging circumstances.<br>\t3.\tEmpathy and Understanding: Those who have experienced hardship may have a heightened ability to understand and empathize with others who are struggling, which can make them more compassionate leaders or team members.<br>\t4.\tMotivation: Sometimes, adverse experiences can serve as motivation. The desire to overcome a difficult past can drive individuals to achieve at high levels.<br>\t5.\tPerspective: Tough experiences often provide a broader perspective on life, which can lead to greater introspection, understanding, and sometimes, intelligence.<br><br>However, it’s important to remember that hardship isn’t a prerequisite for becoming exceptionally intelligent or mentally strong. There are plenty of people who achieve great things without having faced major adversity. It’s also worth noting that extreme adversity can also have detrimental effects if adequate support and coping mechanisms aren’t in place.<br><br>Ad astra per aspera ✨"
