Until I saw this YT short months ago and said &quot;huh the sweet and salty going well together?&quot; At the time Dominos was promoting 50% or 30% off pizza coupon, so I bought 2 medium pizzas. One was a supreme pizza and the other extra anchovies with extra  pineapple. I tried it again same result still fucking salty but the pineapple kinda help. I had to muster up the strength to finish the damn thing. Perhaps I should&#39;ve done some anchovies with extra pineapple, I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m sure as hell not trying it a 3rd time 🤣"

            "text": "Anchovies are amazing on pizza. But not sure pineapple would be. But i could be wrong especially if it&#39;s a good pizza elon was born same day as me just years apart. He actually doesn&#39;t seem all that bad. He has a good head on his shoulders its crazy cause being younger i wouldnt have gotten that but being older i lover anchovies. I used to make my own custom pan from dominos but the one i worked at didnt have them but luckily my now ex at her store carried them. I made a pie on pan but not pineapple 😂 but i dont even think i grabbed a slice haha. It was that good. It went quick haha luckily i got more than one can of anchovies. Still not sure about pineapple with it. But i love fish. Wish i could actually fish and i could do so much with it. Bass, catfish snapper, etc i love fish and its good for you. Love red meat but fiah have more health benefits. Joe and Elon definitely have respect. I mean he was born on the same day he cant be bad ive only met several and we always got along. I will say i used to sleep where i worked and definitely helped out but not sure how i feel about that with his plan. Luckily i dont have kids but i do have a brother and cat i need to look over. My ex&#39;s stopped me from looking over them. Not to mention other stuff but i missed out 5 plus years without them because of weird girlfriends. One ex with my cat im sure let him out during before 2021 freeze in austin just to spite me. But i looked for my cat before and after work and he eventually came back like 5 or more days later. She actually wanted to keep him but we were bonded after he looked at me at a petco or petsmart 😂😅. She even said it. I didnt even want to take in another pet but he was fixated on me and he was all alone. Someone took his sister and another cat so when he looked at me and it wasnt because of being scared i just knew i had to. Her dog now mine but more so my parents ( and they could use protection) i got the dog too. I spent 3 months to gain that dogs trust, probably cause of bad ownership. After the break up my ex eventually asked if i could take back loki, my cat, and luna,her dog but also my dog after everything,.  Luna because apartments i couldnt keep and they are jaded cause she was about 50 pounds. I asked if my parents could take her, god bless and because they are older i think they could use her for protection and she is so much better now its crazy. Just needed a stable home. My cat is amazing too. They have my heart. She let him,loki, run away i think i might&#39;ve been intentionally. I came back from work and still had to eat. More i could say but im already writing a book. She wasnt good and just a terrible parent and pet owner. Oh she also stole all my coins ive had since i was young. I asked for them back so many times. She actually asked me for money and my brother when she probably  literally stole 10k and probably more from me and her dumdum sold em for chumpchange."

So dont think of an idea. Think of a problem to solve. This is very important. <br><br>2. When you have a solution to a problem be different meaning you can offer lower cost or offer be quality or better delivery times. Something differentiated. <br><br>3. If you don&#39;t have large reserves of money it will be hard to compete in mature markets. So better to create a product or service that is innovative. And enter a newer market that&#39;s growing. Example a.i, sustainable consumption these markets are growing fast so easier to open a company in this. <br><br>So live in the future and build something you really want and it solves a problem. <br><br>And have mindset and visualization where you want to be do this daily.

I had never had anchovies before but always wated to try them. The only other person i know that loves anchovy pizza is fry from futurama. Ever since i saw fry eat it i had always craved it and always wondered what it would taste like. Personally i love hawaiian pizza with tons of pineapple and ham and when i put tapatio hot sauce on it it&#39;s the absolute best imo."
