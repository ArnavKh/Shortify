They see one dramatic scene from the first season (where he was told to play it up like American Masterchef) instead of looking at the show in full and seeing for the most part he is a chill guy, he is just not afraid to be honest with you to give you a push in the right direction. But since most of y’all are too lazy to watch the show before coming to conclusions you make up bullshit. For instance those who think he did not taste the food would know he did if they actually watched this part of the show."
