Of course adding fat is great, not saying you shouldn&#39;t, just saying that all these chefs would be unable to give you a good scrambled egg if they ran out of butter.

Cook your meal without a fuss and go about your day. This guy is simply doing that but with arrogance and overconfident attitude and in my opinion, and agreeing to the fact that restaurant business takes basic culinary skill, consistency, and ethics, but I feel he has gaslightighed his way to earn this celebrity chef status. Yes being a celebrity is about being really average but filled with passion of stardom and an overconfident attitude. Not trying to demean anyone here and I think one should be happy where they are or strive to be wherever they want to be.  However lastly to be honest food is an emotional issue and apart from gaining and developing a few scientific trickery here and there, the most celebrated chef in the world cannot tell a person to make food this or that way if we talk about making basic dishes. One I saw him preaching Thai fried rice to Thai chefs and he couldn&#39;t take their criticism: a case of inflated ego."

But you add it too your massive batch of pre scrambled eggs. With also heavy cream. First you would season your pans before you even start cooking. You know why? Its simple, you need to make scrambled eggs for 20 people at a time, where would find time to make 2 or 3 orders of eggs at a time for 3 mins. He is showing how you make one order of eggs.

If you want a cluncky egg with big overcoocked pieces and not an homogeneous fluffy scrambled egg that is soft and delicious i don&#39;t know what to tell you. And by the way eggs like that would never be raw,  that&#39;s just stupid to think. It&#39;s normal that with the butter and cream the results would be more creamy, that doesn&#39;t literally mean anything about the heat received by the egg. Plus, this is clearly the british variant , as Wikipedia says : &quot;In¬†British¬†style, the scrambled eggs are stirred thoroughly during cooking to give a soft, fine texture.&quot; , so it&#39;s literally the point to have it soft and creamy and not overcoocked blobs of egg...smh"

Pre minced beef cooked pink will open you up to all sorts of gut pain, shits and the smell of mince that‚Äôs not fully cooked is rank. An 8oz ribeye minced a la minute sure, a burger that‚Äôs been sitting in a fridge made on Tuesday deteriorating? Fuck that. I reckon people just eat things because it‚Äôs either tradition, peer pressure or trendy. The Norwegians have lutefisk ( rank it‚Äôs rarely touched at Norwegian buffets) ,the French foie grois ( the methods in whcih its procured is straight up evil, can eating liver that has cirrhosis benefit is in anyway?) the Chinese live monkey brains?!?! Why?!? And North Americans med rare burgers‚Ä¶.. warm myoglobin saturating your bun ??? Nah. I get shit from sone chefs for my views but these chefs I could cook under the table. I‚Äôm far from vegan but some foods are just shit"

You put on the lowest heat, add butter or oil, whichever you prefer. Add the eggs and gently stir, make sure to never stop moving it, and never increase the heat because that will change the texture. Be patient. No creme fresche or anything needed. Soon enough you will have fluffy scrambled egg that you can transfer straight to the plate. Now you can add salt and pepper or any garnish you like. Very important, never add salt before it is finished because Salt early will turn the eggs gray and nasty. Enjoy."

They were so damn wet and liquid just like in this video, if I had kept eating them I would&#39;ve thrown up. Both the consistency and the taste were horrible and adding salt and pepper didn&#39;t help.
