Just for you.That is how much you matter to God. <br>Believe in the Righteous Almighty God, and be saved.<br><br>Do you want to have a relationship with someone who loves you beyond any other love. Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved. Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately,  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. This leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dying on the cross. 3 days later, he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. This does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God every day. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch of words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress. This does not mean long prayers are bad always pray out of the heart. Give thanks also when you pray. The Father   (also God) sent his only son Jesus Christ to die for you. Rejoice brothers and sisters because your price was payed by Jesus Christ death.<br>Acts 16:31<br>They replied, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household.&quot;<br>🎉<br>Jesus loves You, smile, isn&#39;t that just amazing❤😊🎉<br>Keep trying, no matter what problem that you face. The power of God can strengthen you, and help you, just turn to God<br>all glory to the almighty, and only God😊❤😊❤"
