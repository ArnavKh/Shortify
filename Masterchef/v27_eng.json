            "text": "if you guys realise in every episode of masterchef, the chef there just follows what Gordon Ramsay comments.. For example when Gordon says the cooking is bad and throws up the food again.. then all the chefs there just do the same thing without telling any specific reason what’s wrong with the food 😅they are just a copy cat.. Only Chef alvin is not a copy cat.. Usually Alvin reaction, comment, is different from the others .. alvin will say the food is good if the food is really good even if gordon says the food is bad..😊"

            "text": "I’m surpised Gordon also has never tried Chicago pizza or has he. Definitely he should also try Detroit pizza if he’s never had it before. Chicago and Detroit have great pizza. This is why the Cubs and the Tigers win a lot of games because they have advertisements of their types of pizzas all around the two cities. My favorite pizza is the one and only 50s style New York pizza from 5 different boroughs: The Bronx, Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. Best pizzas in all 5 boroughs of NYC such as Tommy’s, Joey’s, Frank’s, Crosby’s, the late Lenny’s, the late Sorrento’s, Joe’s, and further more. If you haven’t been to any of these pizzerias in your life you definitely gotta get over there to get some very tasty pizza. New Haven has very great pizza too like Frank Pepe’s and Sally’s. The secondary campus for Frank Pepe’s is in Yonkers but are scattered across the country. The original location of Frank Pepe’s is in New Haven like I mentioned and it’s way more superior for their pizza. If you live in The Bronx, if you live in Manhattan, if you live in Westchester you definitely should take the New Haven line up to New Haven and get that very great pizza. I would recommend it to anyone. <br><br>For some reason I thought of pizza and the thought of Gordon Ramsay probably having not have tried Chicago or Detroit pizza. It’s very strange how that thought came up but oh well"

We’ve all been on the highway when emergency vehicles is coming. Ppl don’t stop to the side till they are right behind them. Ur supposed to stop when u see them coming even if they’re a couple km behind. Most ppl speed up to not get stuck in traffic. I saw the chase on instagram. All of those drivers saw the chase coming but didn’t pull to the side till it was right infront of them. Not saying that’s what the victims did but that’s what most ppl in the chase video were doing.

One thing many people get mixed up is that Christianity is a “religion” when in reality it’s the complete opposite . It’s a relationship with God. And not in that type of way but in a fatherly way.. He loves you and knows your name (John 3:16) (exodus 33:17). He knows how many hairs are on your head to this second ( Luke 12:7) …  God made it easy to go into heaven but it’s up to you to accept him or  not. All we have to do is firstly believe in what he done for you on the cross.. he took the punishment for sin and died on the cross for you willingly (galations 1:4)  God knew before hand the pain he would have to suffer on the cross for you. But he still chose to do it because He Loves You…  but not only did he die in the cross for you.. but he rose again on the third day! When believeing that truely we turn from our sins and pick up our cross ( not physically ofc) and follow him letting him lead us guide us through life.. Some people may even ask how do I know if he even real?? God said in his word seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you (Mathew 7:7-8).. call out to Jesus even if you have to ask him to reveal himself to you he will…. He love you💕<br><br>Gospel of salvation 💕<br>.<br>1 Corinthian 15:1-4 <br><br>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br>2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br>3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>——"

Just for you.That is how much you matter to God. <br>Believe in the Righteous Almighty God, and be saved.<br><br>Do you want to have a relationship with someone who loves you beyond any other love. Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved. Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately,  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. This leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dying on the cross. 3 days later, he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. This does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God every day. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch of words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress. This does not mean long prayers are bad always pray out of the heart. Give thanks also when you pray. The Father   (also God) sent his only son Jesus Christ to die for you. Rejoice brothers and sisters because your price was payed by Jesus Christ death.<br>Acts 16:31<br>They replied, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household.&quot;<br>🎉<br>Jesus loves You, smile, isn&#39;t that just amazing❤😊🎉<br>Keep trying, no matter what problem that you face. The power of God can strengthen you, and help you, just turn to God<br>all glory to the almighty, and only God😊❤😊❤"
