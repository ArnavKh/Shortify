Jesus, while remaining fully God, became fully man at the same time and died to save us from our sins. God the Father physically raised Him from the dead, and Jesus is now in Heaven, interceding for those He saves. Shortly before Jesus died, He experienced separation from God the Father for the first time in all eternity. We have all sinned, but Jesus paid the price for all of the sins we have made and will make, so if we believe in Him, and trust in your heart that Jesus is Lord, and believe that God raised Him from the dead, we will be saved from a place where the unbeliever will suffer in awful pain and darkness by themself forever after they pass away. We can go to Heaven when we pass away, and live with Jesus the Christ and other believers in joy and happiness."
