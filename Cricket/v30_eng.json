And when kohli was introduced he was nothing he got his prime in Ms Dhoni&#39;s captaincy who gave him a lot of chances to save his career ..... Even kohli itself has said that MSD has saved my career many times ..... Moreover most of the Indian players were not showing their revenge by fighting back in words and they use to show their revenge by theri batting or bowling talent ..... But virat just know to fight many times bowlers are having fun of him ..... For the best example MSD is the most calm player of the team but he had become the most successful captain and best finisher , best wicket keeper etc ..... So simply don&#39;t say it&#39;s virat&#39;s era virat was just a player in that era ....."
