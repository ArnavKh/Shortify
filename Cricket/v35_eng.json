Show me if Ponting or other player has scored atleast 50 runs in 6 different icc knockouts, and more importantly Sachin has done this alongwith scoring consistently till SEMIS of 3 different ODI WCs of 1996 2003 and even 2011 🙄😊<br>By the way, no player ever has consistently performed well and made team win individually by his own efforts in every single match including Final of ODI WC, even GILLY PONTING etc. haven&#39;t performed in every game of any WC consistently from 1st match till Final. So, better understand that other players in team MUST perform with atleast half consistency in most games in WC, which real culprits like 1996 Azhar Prabhakar Kambli Manjrekar, 1999 Azhar Mongia etc. and 2003 Dravid Yuvi Kaif Ganguly DineshMongia etc. never showed ever in any WC. 🙄☹️<br>Same applies when Kohli alone (or any other consistent runscorer) is targeted instead of other real culprits 🙄<br><br>And if you&#39;re so desperate for comparison, then compare same era players only with same peak year phases, unlike Sachin peak years from 1991 to 1998 &amp; Mcgrath peak years from 1999 to 2007.
