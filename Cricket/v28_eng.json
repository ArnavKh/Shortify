However, Kohli, determined to make a mark, took charge and delivered a phenomenal performance, ably supported by Axar and Dube. During our bowling spell, Arshdeep, Bumrah, and Axar shone bright, with Axar&#39;s 15th over being a game-changer for SA.Equations changed. They needed 30 from 30. Just when South Africa seemed poised to win their maiden title, Bumrah&#39;s 16th over and Hardik&#39;s crucial wicket of Klassen turned the tide. Our bowlers, led by Bumrah, Arshdeep, and Pandya, ensured India&#39;s triumphant win, making it a perfect farewell for Rohit and Kohli. I was filled with unwavering belief, even when South Africa needed 30 runs from 30 balls. Thank you, India, for this historic victory! Long live India! 🇮🇳<br>(P.S.
