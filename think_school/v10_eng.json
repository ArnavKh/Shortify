Many Indian businessmen, with the exception of a few like Tata, exploit engineers and the workforce to increase their own profits. The government seems to support this by allowing businessmen to enjoy privileges, while the employees who contribute to the success of these companies are left behind. In sectors like IT, governments heavily invest in infrastructure, but without similar support for manufacturing, the country cannot grow. For the past 75 years, the Indian government has offered little motivation to the manufacturing sector. India cannot become a global superpower if it continues to neglect and exploit its manufacturing workforce while relying on borrowed knowledge and ideas. Real growth requires support, innovation, and proper treatment of the manufacturing industry and its workers."
