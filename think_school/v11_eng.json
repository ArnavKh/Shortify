It is important to note that the Great  Recession occurred between december 2007  and June 2009.  <br>Additionally, the price of petrol in 2013  was approximately 70 rupees, while the  price of oil per barrel at that time  exceeded 100 USd. Currently, the price per  barrel is around 70 USD, yet consumers are  paying between 100 and 110 rupees for  petrol,  <br>It is commendable that citizens are  contributing to the nation&#39;s economy by  paying higher prices, as this helps maintain  the affordability of various goods,  including vegetables. It is worth recalling  that certain individuals organized protests  using bullock carts in 2013.  <br>Furthermore, the situation with gas  cylinders is rather amusing. While the  government provides free connections, the  cylinders often remain unrefilled and are  repurposed as chairs.  <br><br>Can someone make a video explaining the recent surge in Indian youth migration?
