            "text": "Extremely bad idea!<br><br>The idea of using YouTube videos and AI tools like ChatGPT to replace traditional lectures in tertiary education may seem convenient and cost-effective, but it misses a crucial aspect of learning‚Äîthe <b>*human connection*</b> between teacher and student. Education is not merely about delivering information; it is about the <b>*exchange of energy**, **passion**, and **intent*</b> that happens in real-time during a lecture. A recorded video may convey facts, but it cannot replicate the spontaneity, emotion, and personalized guidance that a teacher offers in the moment. The <b>*aura*</b> of the teacher‚Äîtheir tone, body language, and enthusiasm for the subject‚Äîplays a significant role in making complex ideas more understandable and memorable. The way in which a teacher adjusts their explanation based on the immediate feedback from students or engages them through lively discussions creates a dynamic learning environment that goes far beyond passive consumption of content.<br><br>Furthermore, while AI tools like ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful for answering questions or providing supplemental information, they cannot replace the <b>*mentorship*</b> and <b>*personal touch*</b> a teacher brings to the classroom. Teachers inspire, motivate, and challenge students to think critically, question assumptions, and explore new perspectives. These human interactions foster intellectual growth and emotional resilience in students‚Äîskills that are essential in life, not just in academics. The role of a teacher is not only to impart knowledge but also to **shape character**, nurture curiosity, and instill confidence in students. Thus, reducing education to recorded videos and automated responses undermines the rich, transformative experience that a true teacher-student relationship offers."

            "text": "I don&#39;t agree. Most of the holistic learning a person has after coming out of high school at the age of 18-19 is in college directly or indirectly like working in labs, interacting with prof, playing sports for college team, hanging out with friends and many other things. Study is not just the only metric. In India it is especially not suitable because it is easy to fool parents who are having expectations from you and are not from the same background of studies. What if you are watching some random YT video but you pretend in front of them, which affects a person&#39;s personality in the long term  when it comes to commitment and responsibility. In college,the hectic classes, regular exams at least give you no choice of skipping it otherwise you will fail. Harvard, Stanford lectures are still freely available for those who have a clear goal but not the majority of students have it. Also the most important thing as a fresher in a company after undergrad is to communicate, if you are only studying from YouTube in a room for 3-4 years of bachelor and have no human to human interaction on innovations, research etc. definitely you will have panic disorders and social anxiety in a corporate world where there is daily standup meeting, knowledge sharing sessions and a hell of other things. So young people should not be MISGUIDED. Classroom study definitely needs improvement but shouldn&#39;t be completely cancelled."

But i think they are missing one point here. He didn&#39;t say that students would not go the school/college rather he said that theoretical portion should be uploaded in the media platforms like you tube, where a student can access it for free and the schools/ colleges must focus on research and practical knowledge . Which means students would still go to school/college but this time for practical knowledge and since they are going to school/college then according to your doubt they are getting the moral development too. And earlier education institutes could not manage the overall development of the student because of the burden of theoretical portion but now they are free from this burden and now focus on the practical knowledge and moral development of the student. But  he also believes that atleast upto primary level school/college should provide theoretical lecture in class and after that a student is mature enough to access the theory uploaded on media platforms like you tube for free."

The world is changing so rapidly and every subject is getting updated every six months, so recorded lectures won&#39;t work. But again, this is an agenda from the government. They can&#39;t handle the budgets well, when questions are being asked for the lower budget for education in spite of collecting so much Education cess, but instead of opening up those new training, research and infrastructure facilities, they are now  eyeing their cost cutting drive on University lecturer&#39;s salary which is huge by volume.
