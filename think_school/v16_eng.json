Getting piped water is a dream, inspite of surplus electricity- we still have power cuts, inspite of ability to build a metro or have buses- we still have traffic bottleneck. So a lot of our time is wasted on doing these chores and we cannot aspire to go further."

The push and competitiveness and uncertainty in nowadays life is throwing many people into situations where they pay too many taxes, havo no time for the family, are too tired to exercise, can&#39;t stretch their salaries enough in many cases and fall to a bur out or depression. Also the prescribed drugs nowadays are intensifying this problem.<br>Soon they will tell us we must work like the asians do, 6 days a week, 14 hours a day, with 2 weeks leave per year. Is that what we want, need or deserve? Of course not."
